<h1 align="center">Tic Tac Toe App</h1>
 <h1>Overview</h1>
 <h5>The Tic Tac Toe App is a digital implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, designed to be played on smartphones, tablets, or computers. It provides a convenient and interactive way for players to enjoy the game without the need for paper, pencils, or a physical game board.</h5>
 <h5>A Tic Tac Toe game app is a simple and classic two-player game where players take turns marking X or O on a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is to get three of their own marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before the opponent does.
</h5>
<h1>Components</h1>
<h2 align="center">The app typically includes the following components:</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Text Field: The text field show after the starting the game in this text field enterd the players name,if the game end than show winner(player name). </li>
 <li>Game Board: This is a 3x3 grid where players make their moves by tapping on the cells. It visually represents the current state of the game.</li>
 <li>Player Turns: The app indicates which player's turn it is, typically by displaying their respective mark (X or O) and highlighting their name or icon.</li>
 <li>Move Validation: The app validates each move to ensure it is valid and that the selected cell is empty. If an invalid move is made, the app prompts the player to try again.</li>
 <li> Win Detection: After each move, the app checks if a player has won the game by having three of their marks in a row or column. If a win condition is true, the app declares the winner name and ends the game.</li>
 <li>Draw Detection: If all the cells are filled and no player has won, the game is declared a draw.</li>
